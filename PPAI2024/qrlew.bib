abstract = {Differential privacy promises to enable general data analytics while protecting individual privacy, but existing differential privacy mechanisms do not support the wide variety of features and databases used in real-world SQL-based analytics systems.This paper presents the first practical approach for differential privacy of SQL queries. Using 8.1 million real-world queries, we conduct an empirical study to determine the requirements for practical differential privacy, and discuss limitations of previous approaches in light of these requirements. To meet these requirements we propose elastic sensitivity, a novel method for approximating the local sensitivity of queries with general equijoins. We prove that elastic sensitivity is an upper bound on local sensitivity and can therefore be used to enforce differential privacy using any local sensitivity-based mechanism.We build Flex, a practical end-to-end system to enforce differential privacy for SQL queries using elastic sensitivity. We demonstrate that FLEX is compatible with any existing database, can enforce differential privacy for real-world SQL queries, and incurs negligible (0.03\%) performance overhead.},

abstract = {Differential privacy is considered a de facto standard for private data analysis. However, the definition and much of the supporting literature applies to flat tables. While there exist variants of the definition and specialized algorithms for specific types of relational data (e.g. graphs), there isn't a general privacy definition for multi-relational schemas with constraints, and no system that permits accurate differentially private answering of SQL queries while imposing a fixed privacy budget across all queries posed by the analyst.This work presents PrivateSQL, a first-of-its-kind end-to-end differentially private relational database system. PrivateSQL allows an analyst to query data stored in a standard database management system using a rich class of SQL counting queries. PrivateSQL adopts a novel generalization of differential privacy to multi-relational data that takes into account constraints in the schema like foreign keys, and allows the data owner to flexibly specify entities in the schema that need privacy. PrivateSQL ensures a fixed privacy loss across all the queries posed by the analyst by answering queries on private synopses generated from several views over the base relation that are tuned to have low error on a representative query workload. We experimentally evaluate PrivateSQL on a real-world dataset and a workload of more than 3, 600 queries. We show that for 50\% of the queries PrivateSQL offers at least 1, 000x better error rates than solutions adapted from prior work.},

abstract = {This article examines the problem of automatte explanation of reasoning, especially as it relates to expert systems. By explanation we mean the ability of a program to discuss what it is doing in some understandable way. We first present a general framework in which to view explanation and review some of the research done in this area. We then focus on the explanation system for NEOMYCIN, a medical consultation program. A consultation program interactively helps a user to solve a problem. Our goal is to have NEOMYCIN explain its problem-solving strategies. An explanation of strategy describes the plan the program is using to reach a solution. Such an explanation is usually concrete, referring to aspects of the current problem situation. Abstract explanations articulate a general principle, which can be applied in different situations; such explanations are useful in teaching and in explaining by analogy. We describe the aspects of NEOMYCIN that make abstract strategic explanations possible—the representation of strategic knowledge explicitly and separately from domain knowledge— and demonstrate how this representation can be used to generate explanations.}
