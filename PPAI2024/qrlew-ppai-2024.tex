\section{Introduction}

In recent years, the importance of safeguarding privacy when dealing with personal data has continuously increased.
Traditional anonymization techniques have proven vulnerable to re-identification, as demonstrated by numerous works \cite{archie2018s, dwork2017exposed, narayanan2008robust, sweeney2013identifying}. The total cost of data breaches has also significantly increased \cite{ibm2023cost}. And governments have introduced stricter data protection laws.
Yet, the collection, sharing, and utilization of data hold the potential to generate significant value across various industries, including healthcare, finance, transportation, and energy distribution.

To realize these benefits while managing privacy risks, researchers have turned to \emph{differential privacy (DP)} \cite{wood2018differential, dwork2014algorithmic}, which has become the gold standard in academia since its introduction by Dwork et al. in 2006 \cite{dwork2006calibrating} due to its provable and automatic privacy guarantees.

Despite the availability of open-source tools, DP adoption remains limited. One of the reasons for this lack of adoption is the relative complexity of the existing tools considered the utility of the results.
\qrlew{} has been designed to solve this problem, by providing the following features:
\begin{description}
    \item[Leverages existing infrastructure] \qrlew{} rewrites a SQL query into a \emph{differentially private} equivalent.
    \item[Is fully automated] \qrlew{} can rewrite a large class of queries into \emph{differentially private} ones.
    \item[Leverages synthetic data] using jointly \emph{differentially private} mechanisms and \emph{differentially private} Synthetic Data
\end{description}

In summary, our main contributions are as follows:

% Motivation DP
% Solutions existantes
% Problème non résolu et nécessité de \qrlew

% à développer plus:
% - adaptativité -> utiliser output DP pour tuner DP aval
% - More mechanisms
% - Interconnectivité

\section{Known limitations}

\qrlew{} relies on the random number generator of the SQL engine used. It is usually not a cryptographic noise.

\qrlew{} uses the floating-point numbers of the host SQL engine, therefore our system is liable to the vulnerabilities described in
